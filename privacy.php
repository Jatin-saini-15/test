                                We collect personal information about our users to provide our products, services, and customer support. Our products, services, and customer support are provided through many platforms including but not limited to: websites, phone apps, email, and telephone.
                                The specific platform and product, service, or support you interact with may affect the personal data we collect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us is "Personal Information" as it does not identify you as a specific natural person. This will include the majority of "User Generated Content" that you provide us with the intention of sharing
                                with other users. Such "Non-Personal Information" is not covered by this privacy policy. However, as non-personal information may be used in aggregate or be linked with existing personal information; when in this form it
                                will be treated as personal information. As such, this privacy policy will list both types of information for the sake of transparency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In some situations users may provide us with personal information without us asking for it, or through means not intended for the collection of particular types of information. Whilst we may take reasonable steps to protect this data, the user will have
                                bypassed our systems, processes, and control and thus the information provided will not be governed by this privacy policy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In some situations users may provide us personal information over platforms that are outside our control; for example through social media or forums. Whilst any information collected by us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform by which it was
                                communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Information that you specifically give us<br> While you use our products and services you may be asked to provide certain types of personal information. This might happen through our website, applications, online chat systems,
                                telephone, paper forms, or in-person meetings. We will give you a Collection Notice at the time, to explain how we will use the personal information we are asking for. The notice may be written or verbal.
